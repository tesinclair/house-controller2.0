# House Controller 2.0

## Project Description
This project aims to provide a comprehensive and modular smart home control system, "House Controller 2.0". It integrates various components for managing household devices, including GPIO-controlled elements and potentially AI-driven functionalities for enhanced automation.

## Features
-   **API for device control:** Python-based API for interacting with GPIO pins and other hardware.
-   **Socket communication:** Real-time communication capabilities for seamless interaction between components.
-   **Desktop Application:** A GTK-based desktop application for user interaction and control (based on `src/app`).
-   **Mobile Application (Deprecated):** Former mobile application components (found in `.deprecated/mobile-app`) are no longer actively maintained.
-   **Utility Libraries:** C-based utilities for various functionalities, including AI, client communication, error handling, lighting, and stack management.

## Setup
Detailed setup instructions for each component (API, Desktop App) will be provided in their respective directories or dedicated documentation files.

### API Setup
(Refer to `src/api/README.md` if available, or create one)

### Desktop App Setup
(Refer to `src/app/README.md` if available, or create one)

## Documentation Structure
-   `docs/desktop-app-design.drawio`: Design diagrams for the desktop application.
-   `docs/gpio-event-loop.drawio`: Diagrams illustrating the GPIO event loop.
-   `docs/mobile-app-design.drawio`: Design diagrams for the (deprecated) mobile application.
-   `docs/README.md`: This file.
